Preliminary Hardware Bill of Materials
======================================

Note: subject to change at random.

Raspberry Pi B+ (logic board - could substitute Beaglebone Black)
7-port powered USB hub (power supply and backplane)
Adafruit HDMI 4 Pi 10in display (http://www.adafruit.com/products/1287)
Cirago BTA7300 Wifi/Bluetooth 3.0 adapter (does not support Bluetooth LE)
short (~1ft) HDMI A-A cable (A-D for BBB)
USB A male -> A female port extender (cracked open with power wire cut - may not be needed) (connects USB host port to hub)
USB A -> 5.2mm barrel jack male (center+) cable (power to screen)
USB keyboard and mouse

This configuration is so far untested as I've been primarily been trying to get the software working. If you try it, let me 
know if you come up with a fried Pi or anything else goes wrong.
