About Lexington Gothic
======================

The Apple Lisa used a rather odd-looking system font that only faintly resembled the Mac's Chicago font, but showed clear influence from the works of type designers from the 60s and 70s like Ed Benguiat and Herb Lubalin. Lexington Gothic is based on that unnamed font, as (approximately) rendered by Ray Arachelian's LisaEm emulator. (Some liberties were taken, since the emulator has trouble with rendering Lisa's rectangular pixels, but I tried to get things as close as I could based on the system's dialog boxes.) 

This release covers the Latin-1 character set in regular and oblique styles. I intend eventually to add at least central European Latin, Cyrillic, Greek, and Hebrew characters. The archive includes the font in TrueType format as created by FontStruct.com and in SFD format for use by FontForge.
